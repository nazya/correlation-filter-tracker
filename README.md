*Multi-channel correlation filter tracker
## Description 
Simple implementation of the multi-channel correlation filter algorithm, described by Hamed Kiani Galoogahi, Terence Sim and Simon Lucey (https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/2013/0/2013_ICCV_Kiani.pdf)
Implemented the overlap-based measure of tracking quality. One can follow the article https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.05803.pdf for more information.
Current implementation allows to check the algorithm on VOT2013 dataset.
